# flask-rest-api

A simple REST API in Flask written for Task Manager webservice

`<img placeholder>`

A short project about REST APIs related to my [other project](https://github.com/msztylko/flask-task-manager). I decided to keep them separate for now, because my main goal is to explore more topics and tools related to API development rather than creating full Task Manager web application. I hope to use this project as a reference for future projects involving REST APIs with Flask.
